# Performance and useCallback

useCallback is a hook that is used for improving our component performance
If you have a component that re-renders frequently, useCallback prevents callback functions within the component from being recreated every single time the component re-renders (which mean the function component re-runs)
useCallback re-runs only when one of it's dependencies chang

```ts
// in Timer, we are calculating the date and putting it in state a lot
// this results in a re-render for every state update

// we had a function handleIncrementCount to increment the state 'count'...
function Timer() {
  const [time, setTime] = React.useState();
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  // ... but unless we wrap it in useCallback, the function is
  // recreated for every single re-render (bad performance hit)
  // useCallback hook returns a callback that isn't recreated every time
  const inc = React.useCallback(
    function handleIncrementCount() {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    },
    // useCallback accepts a second arg of a dependencies array like useEffect
    // useCallback will only run if any dependency changes (here it's 'setCount')
    [setCount]
  );

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      const currentTime = JSON.stringify(new Date(Date.now()));
      setTime(currentTime);
    }, 300);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout);
    };
  }, [time]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current time is {time}</p>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={inc}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
