# Context

## When to Use Context

* Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. 
* Ex. manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component:

```ts
class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <Toolbar theme="dark" />;
    }
}

function Toolbar(props) {
    // The Toolbar component must take an extra "theme" prop
    // and pass it to the ThemedButton. This can become painful
    // if every single button in the app needs to know the theme
    // because it would have to be passed through all components.
    return(
        <div>
            <ThemedButton theme={props.theme} />
        </div>
    );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <Button theme={this.props.theme} />;
    }
}
```

* Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements:

```ts
// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree
// without explicitly threading it through every component.
// Create a context for the current theme (with "light" as the default).

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
        // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
        // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
        // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
        return (
            <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
                <Toolbar />
            </ThemContext.Provider>
        );
    }
}

// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar() {
    return (
        <div>
            <ThemedButton />
        </div>
    );
}

class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
    // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
    // React will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
    // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
    static contextType = ThemeContext;
    render() {
        return <Button theme={this.context} />;
    }
}
```
